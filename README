THOUGHT MACHINE BATTLESHIP PROGRAMMING TEST

-------------------------------------------
RUNNING THE PROGRAM
-------------------------------------------

Either download the directory or pull using git.
Using command line change to the root directory
    e.g. on windows `cd C:\battleships\`  if project was extracted/pulled to root directory

TO BUILD
-------------------------------------------
run command: C:\battleships> gradle build

TO TEST
-------------------------------------------
run command C:\battleships> gradle test
    This will use the test files in the directory src\main\resources\tests\ to run the tests
    and compare it with its associated expected output

TO RUN
-------------------------------------------
run command: C:\battleships> gradle run
    This will run the commands in src\main\resources\input.txt and output the results into src\main\resources\output.txt


-------------------------------------------
NOTES
-------------------------------------------

1. Only basic validation has been implemented as there was no specification to thoroughly check user input
2. Assumes that first line will always be the the board size, 2nd line the initialisation of the ships and any following
    lines are operations.
3. Will read inputs from inputs.txt located in src\main\resources\input.txt and outputs to outputs.txt in that same folder
4. Use of HashMaps to store the ships for optimisation.
5. Given more time, I would have separated the operations into their own classes with a generic Operation interface
    that could be implemented, allowing multiple operations to be added later on.
